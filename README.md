Data cleaning: The datasets we used as primary sources have more images in total than we need. We operated an in-depth manual eye-skimmed data cleaning process so that we can include most deserving images to the corresponding classes. Hence, we believe the model can get good training data and the model can perform better in the next parts of this project. All the images in our primary the datasets are in grayscale color and in 224 x 224 size.To comply, we have resized the scraped images into 224 x 224 too. 

Data visualization: We used matplotlib and seaborn libraries to visualize the class distribution, sample images in 5x5 grid and histogram of random images.
